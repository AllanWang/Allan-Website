"-All or none event, typically -50mV (20mV more)"
"Axons covered with voltage-gated sodium channels"
"-Closed at resting membrane potential, open when membrane depolarizes"
"-Selective for Na+, flow in"
"-Open channel rapidly inactivates, stopping flow; closed ? open ? inactivated"
"-Inactivated channels cannot activate again until resting potential is reached again"
"-Depolarization activates small fraction of sodium channels, but due to positive feedback, maximal activation happens rapidly; inactivation then brings membrane back down"

"Voltage-gated potassium channels"
"-Closed at resting potential, delayed activation, usually when action potential is at its peak"
"-Help lower action potential time ? allows for more action potentials per second"
"Action potential propagation is caused by spread of electrotonic currents from the site of action potential, which excites adjacent regions of axons"

Lecture 19 – 2016/10/31
Synaptic Physiology
"Three main types of synapses"
"Upstream – presynaptic, downstream – postsynaptic"
"Axodendritic (synapse on dendrite) – spine synapse (excitatory), shaft synapse (inhibitory)"
"Axosomatic – usually inhibitory"
"Axoaxonic – regulatory?"
"Pyramidal cell – main type of cell in cerebral cortex"
"Synapses are very dense"
"A single neuron has only one axon, but it branches and may make synapses with many other neurons"
"-All branches send the same message, action potentials are the same"
"Presynaptic terminal | synaptic cleft | postsynaptic spine"
"-Vesicles – presynaptic vesicles (reserves, lying around), active zone (where vesicles are released)"
"-Postsynaptic density – right across active zones in postsynaptic spine"
"Packed with specialized proteins involved in synaptic communications"
"-Synaptic cleft must be very small and vesicles need to diffuse through rapidly"
Process
"Presynaptic terminal"
"-Voltage-gated calcium channels trigger neurotransmitter release"
"[Ca++] outside of cell is very low, ~1.5mM, [Ca++] inside even lower, 10-7M"
"[Ca++] changes can therefore be used as signalling molecule"
"Postsynaptic spine"
"-Ligand-gated ion channels – gated by binding of small molecule (ligand)"
"Active potential ? Ca channels open ? [Ca] change triggers fusion of synaptic vesicles and presynaptic membrane ? transmitter released into synaptic cleft ? transmitter diffusion across cleft ? receptors activated in postsynaptic membrane ? ligand channels open ? ions flow, electrical change in postsynaptic cell"
"-After vesicles dump its contents, it is reused"
"-Vesicles are held by many proteins (extra: synaptobrevin, synaptotagmin, etc)"
"-Protein complex close with Ca channels, detect changes"
"-Proteins also target of neurotoxins – botox, tetanus toxins, black widow spider venom"
"Botox & tetanus – taken up by presynaptic terminal, protease, chew up proteins, vesicles don’t work properly"
"Excitatory synapses – usually in spine	inhibitory synapse – usually in shaft of dendrites/on cell body"
"Most excitatory synapses release glutamate as neurotransmitter/amino acid"
"Inhibitory synapses release GABA, derived from neurotransmitters"
"Excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) – depolarizes postsynaptic membrane"
"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) – hyperpolarizes postsynaptic membrane"
"Excitatory transmission at synapses primarily due to actions of glutamate on two types of ionotropic glutamate receptors"
"-Ionotropic – ion channels, open in response to binding of small molecules (ie neurotransmitters)"
"-AMPA receptors – responsible for fast EPSP"
"Vesicle fuses ? glutamate released ? binds to AMPA ? core selectively permeable to Na+ ? depolarization = EPSP"
"-NMDA receptors"
"-EPSP is small, transient depolarization"
"Doesn’t last long, 20ms (still 10x longer than action potential)"
"Not very big, ~+2mV"


Lecture 20 – 2016/11/02
"Depolarization by a single EPSP is too small to depolarize the axon initial segment to threshold"
"50-100 EPSPs must sum at initial segment to initiate action potential; can come from multiple synapses acting in synchrony/from individual synapses in high frequencies"
"NMDA receptors – activated by glutamate"
"-At resting membrane potentials, pore blocked by Mg2+, depolarization expels it"
"-Pore highly permeable to Ca2+ as well as monovalent cations"
"-Can be used to check for coincidental factors – glutamate released from presynaptic terminal, postsynaptic membrane is depolarized"
"-Highly active excitatory synapses become stronger (ie larger EPSP) ? synaptic plasticity"

"-Long-term potentiation (LTP) is model of synaptic plasticity"
"-Bursts of action potentials results in high depolarization, unblocking NMDA"
"-Long term potentiation"
"-Glutamate is also a neurotoxin; excitotoxicity ? thought to involve calcium influx through NMDA receptors"

"Neuromodulators"
"-Glutamate & GABA activate both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors"
"-Neuromodulators act only on metabotropic receptors"
"Dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, neuropeptides such as endorphins"
"Not directly involved in fast flow of neural info, but modulate global neural states, alertness, attention, and mood"
"-Often released from small brainstem or midbrain nuclei"
"-Important target for large range of drugs (eg Prozac affects serotonergic transmission)"
"Axoaxonic synapse modulate neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminal"
"-Presynaptic inhibition ? smaller transmission (eg pain signals in spinal cord)"

Skeletal Muscle
"Composed of bundles of long (up to 1ft) thin cells called muscle fibers"
"-Fibers are bundled into groups of fascicles; bundle of fascicles form muscle"
"Striped perpendicular to long axis of fibers"
"Mature muscle fibers are long thin cells with many nuclei"
"-Muscle fibers generated by fusion of large number of myoblasts (precursor cells)"
"-Myoblast has single nucleus, fiber is multinucleated cell"
"-Muscle needs a lot of protein; more efficient to have many nuclei to synthesize it"
"Muscle fiber contains more long thing fibers called myofibril"
"-Also have light and dark stripes; lined up"

"-H zone – area in A band with only thick filaments"
"-M line – middle of H zone/A band"
"Myofibril are arranged three dimensionally, each thick filament is surrounded by 6 thin filaments; each thin filament has 3 surrounding thick filaments"
"Thin filaments consist of actin – each actin filament is formed from two chains of globular actin subunits, twisted into helix"
"Thick filaments are made of myosin – bundles with ends orientated in both directions – attaching section is M-line"
"Sliding filament model – thin filaments pulled over thick filaments by myosin head groups; repeatedly driven by ATP hydrolysis"
"-Energized myosin head groups bind to actin thin filaments"
"-Power stroke"
"-Myosin unbinds & is reenergized"

"-Muscle fiber is covered with voltage gated sodium channels"
"Sarcoplasmic reticulum – intercellular membrane (like endoplasmic reticulum) – compartment"
"T tubule – holes in membrane that go down into the fibers (like a manhole)"
"Action potential propagates along membrane"
"-Once it gets to T-tubules, it goes down, depolarizing it, then back up"
"-Depolarization activates DHP receptors, calcium channels (closed at resting)"
"-Sarcoplasmic reticulum stores calcium, has pumps constantly pumping it in"
"Flows out into cytoplasm, telling the muscle fiber to contract"
"-How are the DHP receptors (bringing Ca in) related to SR bringing Ca out?"
"-Action potential changes calcium channel, which also changes Ryanodine receptors and Ca2_ efflux from SR"


Lecture 23 – 2016/11/09
"Excitation-Contraction coupling – topic of last class"
"-Troponin – calcium binding protein"
"On the thin filaments, when bound to calcium, has conformation change, moves associated tropomyosin molecule away from myosin binding site on actin"
"-Tropomyosin – long thin protein wrapping around actin – blocks myosin binding site"
"Action potential down motor neuron ? ACh release binds to NACh receptor ? Na flows into endplate of muscle fiber ? endplate potential ? action potential down muscle fiber ? invades T tubules ? DHP receptor (calcium channel) activation ? Ryanodine receptor ? Ca2+ efflux ? binds to troponin ? pushes tropomyosin away ? head group cycling initiates"
"Twitch – contraction of muscle fiber in response to a single action potential"
"-Lags behind muscle action potential due to excitation-contraction coupling"
"-Takes longer too (~100ms), time takes for calcium concentration to return to baseline"
"Tension – force generated by muscle"
"-Controlled by recruitment – increase in number of active fibers and summation – additive effects of several closely spaced twitches"
"Tetanus – sustained contraction from bursts from motor neurons"
"-Unfused – twitches spaced almost as long as they take – adds on, but in oscillating pattern"
"Muscle fiber activity requires large amounts of energy; energy demands change dramatically from resting to active state"
"-There is only enough premade ATP in a muscle fiber to last for a few twitches"
"-Transfer of P from creatine phosphate to ADP creates enough ATP for a few seconds of muscle activity"
"-Afterwards, other processes have time to run, ie glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation"
"-Glycogen – long chain of glucose"
"Types of skeletal muscle fibers"
"-Fast glycolytic fibers – myosin with high ATPase activity, no myoglobin (“white muscle”), for generation of large force over short periods of time, eg chicken breast"

"-Fast oxidative fibers – intermediate properties, fast myosin and oxidative metabolism"
"Muscle fatigue"
"-Protects muscle from damage"
"-Not caused by depletion ATP"
"-Not entirely understood – affected by changes in ion gradients (eg increase in extracellular K+), reduction in pH due to build up of lactic acid, depletion of glycogen, central command fatigue"
"Muscle response to exercise"
"-Low-intensity, long-duration – aerobic"
"Increase in fiber mitochondria, increased vascularization (ie ability to extract ATP through oxidative metabolism)"
"High-intensity, short-duration exercise – increase in diameter of fast glycolytic fibers, muscle hypertrophy, more myofibril"
"Smooth muscle – like skeletal muscle in that contraction involves myosin thick filaments pulling on actin thin filaments – unlike skeletal muscle in that it does not have highly ordered structure, lacks striations, hence smooth"
"-Contraction activated by Ca2+ released from SR, involves myosin"
"-Regulated by hormones and neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system"
"Loewi’s experiment"
"-Two frog hearts in physiological solution in separate dishes"
"-One still had vagus nerve, which was known to slow down heart beats when stimulated"
"-He then took some solution from vagus heart container, and put it into the other dish; other heart slowed down too"

"Very little glycogen in brain"
"Brain needs continuous supply of glucose and oxygen (transport into brain does not require insulin)"
"Few seconds of blood supply interruption can lead to loss of consciousness, few minutes can lead to neuronal death (stroke)"
"Brain receives 15% of total blood (but is 2% of total mass)"
"Supply from heart ? aorta (85% of blood goes to body) ? common carotid artery ? external carotid (outside of head) or internal carotid artery (base of brain)"
"-Also a vertebral artery (one on each side) – come together to form basilar artery"
"-After, all come together to form Circle of Willis (safety factor)"
"Since blood is so important, a defect in one can be made up for by another artery"
"Circulation"
"-CSF: heart ? choroid plexus ? ventricles ? subarachnoid space ? arachnoid villi ? dural sinus ? venous system ? heart"
"-Blood: heart ? vertebral arteries (? basilar artery) & carotid arteries ? circle of Willis ? brain ? venous system ? heart"
"Blood-brain barrier (capillary wall) – capillary surrounded by endothelial cells, but in brain there are tight junctions in between those cells"
"-For things to get out into a brain, it must diffuse across membrane (lipid soluble, eg water, CO2, O2, etc) or active transport of glucose and some amino acids"
"Drugs that go through easily: caffeine alcohol, nicotine"
"Drugs that do not: morphine"
"-Also blood-CSF barrier (choroid plexus)"
"Astrocytes (glia) – provide structural support, induce tight junctions, take up excess neurotransmitters"
Perception of external world
"Law of specific nerve energies – regardless of how sensory receptor is activated, sensation felt corresponds to that of which the receptor is specialized (eg rub eyes, see light)"
"Law of projection – regardless of where in brain you stimulate sensory pathway, sensation is always felt at sensory receptor’s location (eg phantom limb pain after amputation)"

"Modality – general class of stimulus"
"Labeled-line – brain “knows” modality and location of every sensory afferent"
"Sensory receptors require adequate stimulus and receptor membrane ? ion channel activation ? afferent action potentials/neurotransmitter release"
"Transduction – process of converting stimulus energy into the opening or closing of ion channels"
"Stimulus detected, receptor potential ? membrane depolarization, action potentials if above threshold, propagation, release of neurotransmitter"
"Strength of stimulus is encoded by magnitude of receptor potential, frequency of action potential, and magnitude of neurotransmitter release"
"Afferents respond in different ways"
"-Non-adapting – firing at constant rate"

"-In the dark, photoreceptors release neurotransmitters"
"Inside outer segment is cGMP, activates sodium channels around photoreceptor ? depolarizes cells ? releases neurotransmitters"
"Activated opsin releases chromophore ? activates G-protein cascade ? converts cGMP to GMP ? cGMP-gated channels are now closed ? transduction results in signalling"
