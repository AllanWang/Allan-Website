"Bit		machine 5V ≡ 1, 3V ≡ 0, 0V ≡ OFF",
"Pathway	voltages can be passed through wire; whole wire becomes given voltage",
"Bus ≡ n-wires ≡ one “unit” of Data",
"-Also a pathway (of n going in the same direction)",
"Gate",
"-Has in and out direction",
"-Freezes if other direction used",
"-Computer freezes because of infinite loops or electricity going the opposite direction",
"CPU",
"-Fast bus, fast clock",
"-IP – instruction pointer – keeps track of where we are in a program",
"-IR – instruction register – sends instruction to sequencer",
"--Eg application opened &rarr; instructions sent to RAM &rarr; instructions sent one at a time to CPU",
"-Seq – sequencer – opens all gates",
"CPU Loop",
"-IR &harr; RAM[IP]",
"-IR &rarr; Seq, IP++		//couldn’t see this",
"Data – information",
"-Eg characters, symbols, numbers",
"Real data translated to code using properties of medium",
"-Which medium should we pick?",
"Real Data &rarr; Numbers		Encoded Data &rarr; everything else",
"-INT ≡ Binary",
"ISO IEEE",
"RAM = ADDR + DATA",
"-Zero page – like a sourcebook table, where data should not be written into?",
"--Bigger zero page &rarr; more stuff pluggable into machine",
"CPU Boundary Register – keeps track of addresses used; addresses requested must never be greater than boundary address",
