"Endocrine – long distance",
"Paracrine – short distance, ie neighbouring cell",
"Autocrine – self, eg growth factor",
"Endocrine signaling",
"-Hormone secretion into blood by endocrine gland &rarr; transported to distant site",
"Communication by hormones (or neurohormones)",
"-Synthesis by endocrine cells",
"-Release by endocrine cells",
"-Transport by blood stream",
"-Detection by specific receptor protein on target cells",
"-Change in cellular metabolism by hormone-receptor interactions",
"-Removal of hormone – terminates cellular response",
"Hypothalamic-Pituitary Signaling",
"Hormones have different types of structures",
"-Peptides | proteins &rarr; Glyco | Poly",
"-Glycoproteins/polypeptides &rarr; must have gene that encodes that hormone",
"-Steroids/Amines do not have genes that encode them",
"--Do have genes that encode enzymes for synthesis of those molecules",
"-Ionic calcium – exists a calcium sensing receptor",
"Synthesis of protein hormones",
"-Transcription of rna from gene",
"-Protein produced is inserted into endoplasmic reticulum",
"-Proteins are transformed from N terminus to C terminus",
"--Preprosequence – additional sequence on N terminus ",
"Not in biologically active hormone",
"Present in primary translation product of that hormone",
"Represent molecular barcodes that direct protein to secretory system",
"Cleaved off during secretory process (no longer present in mature hormone)",
"For glycoproteins, oligosaccharide component is added during trip through endoplasmic reticulum in golgi to primary translation product",
"Structures of some steroid hormones",
"-Cortisol/Aldosterone – similar structures, different physiology",
"-Testosterone – has very important methyl group that stops it from becoming estradiol ",
"-Estradiol – has an aromatic ring",
"--Essential for bone physiology",
"--Women get it from ovaries",
"--Men get it from local conversion of testosterone",
"Has enzyme that burns the methyl group off",
"Thyroid hormones",
"-Not steroids, derived from tyrosine, contain iodine",
"Properties of hormone receptors",
"-Specificity – recognition of single hormone or hormone family",
"-Affinity – binding hormone at its physiological concentration",
"--If concentrations are hugely different, system would be always on/off, not physiological",
"-Should show saturability and have a measurable biological response",
"Receptor regulation",
"-Upregulation – increase activity in response to hormone or synthesis",
"-Downregulated – decreasing activity or synthesis",
"Hormones can exert effects on target cells",
"-Direct effects on function at cell membrane",
"-Intracellular effects mediated by second messenger systems",
"-Intracellular effects mediated by genomic or nuclear action",
"--Eg steroid hormone – hormone binds to receptor in cytoplasm &rarr; transcription in nucleus &rarr; protein synthesis &rarr; altered functional response",
