"Primary hyperthyroidism – level of thyroid gland",
"-Toxic diffuse goiter (Graves Disease; most common)",
"--Autoimmune disease characterized by presence of substance produced by lymphocytes called Long Acting Thyroid Stimulator (LATS), immunoglobulin that mimics action of TSH and stimulating release of T3 & T4",
"--Constant stimulation by LATS → increase in thyroid mass → formation of goiter synthesizing biologically active T4/T3, known as toxic goiter",
"-Thyroid adenoma or thyroid cancer – synthesis of thyroid hormones independent of TSH stimulation",
"Secondary hyperthyroidism – pituitary gland",
"-No negative feedback from increased levels of T3/T4 & synthesized autonomously thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) – often due to presence of pituitary tumor",
"Tertiary hyperthyroidism – hypothalamus",
"-No negative feedback of high T3/T4 to decrease synthesis of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) – often due to presence of hypothalamic tumor",
"Treatment",
"-Depends on severity",
"-Surgery + replacement therapy (administration of thyroid hormones)",
"-Administration of radioactive Iodide (131I) about 5mCi (millicurie) Radioactive iodide concentrates in cells of thyroid follicles and destroys them. Replacement therapy may be administered as needed.",
"-Administration of antithyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil (blocks addition of iodine to thyroglobulin). Must not inhibit synthesis of thyroid hormones to great extent and cause hypothyroidism.",
