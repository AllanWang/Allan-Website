"--Very short half-life – 3-18min",
"-Functions of PTH",
"--Increase concentration of plasma calcium",
"---Bone resorption – increases bone demineralization – increases Ca++ in body fluids",
"---Kidney – increase reabsorption of Ca++ in proximal convoluted tubule",
"---Vitamin D synthesis – stimulates conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3; biologically active form of vitamin D) primarily in kidney",
"---Gut: PTH & 1,25D3 facilitate absorption of Ca++ from gut",
"--Control of PTH release",
"---Controlled directly by circulating concentration of calcium",
"--Mechanism of PTH activity – binds to cognate receptor on target cells exert",
