"-Always balanced	height is O(logn)	worst case operations are O(logn)",
"-+1 bit per node for attribute color: red or black",

"-Properties",
"--Every node is red or black",
"--The root and every leaf is black",
"--If a node is red, its children are black",
"--For each node, all paths from the node to descendant leaves contain same number of black nodes (same black height)",
"-Let",

"--Black height of RBT = bh(root)",
