"-Adenohypophysis – aka anterior pituitary, pars distalis",
"-Neurohypophysis – aka posterior pituitary, pars nervosa",
"--Outgrowth of hypothalamus connected by pituitary stalk",
"--Secretes oxytocin & vasopressin (aka ADH – antiduretic hormone)",
"--Oxytocin & vasopressin synthesized in two hypothalamic nuclei (supraoptic & paraventricular), whose axons run down the pituitary stalk and terminate in the posterior pituitary close to capillary blood vessels",
"--Prohormones processed in secretory granules during axonal transport",
"--Mature hormones liberated from carrier molecules neurophysins",
"--Circulating half lives – 1-3 minutes",
"--Oxytocin – involved in reproductive biology",
"---Females",
"----Parturition (childbirth) – expresses high levels of receptors for oxytocin at the end of pregnancy",
"-----Dilation of uterine cervix by fetal head → release of oxytocin → uterine contraction, assisting expulsion of fetus",
"----Milk ejection – response to stimulus of suckling; causes milk filled ducts to contract",
"----Behavioural effects – local oxytocin release in the brain reduces anxiety and enhances bonding & pro-social behavior",
"---Males",
"----Ejaculation – surge during sexual activity assists epidydimal passage of sperm and ejaculation",
"----Behavioural effects – local oxytocin release in the brain reduces anxiety and enhances bonding & pro-social behavior",
