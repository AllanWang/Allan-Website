"Midterm – definitions, circuit drawing/interpreting, data conversions & representation, RAM, adder, addressing, bus, IR, IP, classical & pipeline CPU, off the shelf circuits, mathematical problems as seen in assignment",
"Pipeline as optimized architecture – clock tick sharing",
"-CU needs to make sure it goes through all the right loops",
"In pipeline, cache<sub>input</sub> &rarr; … &rarr; cache<sub>data</sub> at 2GHz. It is connected to RAM via a slow bus, but to make use of the speed, there are private fast buses going from the RAM to the cache input and data. They operate at 2Ghz + dump, meaning they collect data and send a bunch at once.",
"-Code/load prediction – dumb vs smart (looking one instruction ahead to see when to dump)",
"Fetch portion of CPU",
"-PC goes to read address &rarr; instruction comes out",
"-Instruction R-format",
"--OP – op-code (two; one for each CU)",
"--RS – register source",
"--RT – second register source (optional)",
"--RD – register destination",
"--SHAMT – shift amount (jump)",
"--FUNCT – function-code (ie sub-op-code)",
"-Add portion is always connected to 4, as instruction is 32-bit",
"Load portion of CPU",
"-OP code goes to CU, other parts of instruction go to registers, some portions skip register altogether",
"-Multiple address registers exist so you can fetch and load from multiple addresses at the same time (unlike in RAM where it’s synchronous)",
